# 42-ft-hangouts

## Introduction

**For this project, you will have to design an android application that will allow you to create a contact and send texts.
The goal is to understand how an Android application works, how Android deals with your app and how to use the SDK.**

## Goals

You will have to fulfill various tasks that will help you understand how an Android app in JAVA or Kotlin works.
The goal is to make an app allowing to create a contact(containing at least 5 details), edit it and delete it. Once the contact is recorded, you will have to be able to communicate with him through text messages.
Contacts are recorded persistently (SQLite database, don’t use the shared contacttable. You must create your own).
A sumary for each contact will appear as a list on theapp’s homepage.
You should be able to click on each contact to show their details.
Your app will have to propose two different languages, one being the default language(change the system language for a test).
When you’re on the homepage and set the appin the background, the date will be saved and will show in a _`toast`_ when you return to the front.
You will have to create a menu that will allow you to change the app’s header color.
Finally, the app icon will have to be the 42 logo.
